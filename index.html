            Our graphic design contributes to this, with the harsh contrast of red and black we create a unitary style which is apparant on everything we present. Nevertheless, we don't compromise for good design which looks and feels appealing, and thanks to our sponsors we have been able to deliver that as a team for 3 years.</p>

This wouldn't have been possible without the help of our sponsors who believed in what we were creating. </p>

            <p class="light red-text">In a remote controlled car the common perception is that you are limited to the basic steering, with basic power and off-the-shelf parts. We want to prove that misconception wrong, we want to create a gearbox which optimises our power over rough terrain, one which could rival a Land Rover. We want to create something which the engineer judges from Land Rover haven't seen. Something completely new and never before thought about. and thanks to our sponsors and innovative skills we've managed to create something completely new this year.</p>

            <blockquote class="red-text" cite="http://www.4x4inschools.com/">
              The challenge involves between three and six team members working together to design and build a radio controlled four-wheel drive (4x4) vehicle, to set specifications. The vehicle must be able to successfully negotiate a specially designed test track emulating real life and it must perform as a full scale 4x4 vehicle would do in an off-road situation.
            </blockquote>
            <p class="red-text">
              We compete in the Professional class, meaning our car is completely our own design and engineering. We have to produce pit-side displays, prepare 10-minute verbal presentations, 30-minute engineering talks, as well as a project portfolio documenting our road to the competition.

              It is a tough challenge, and the competition each year is fierce. However, as a team we believe in the best finish possible, and thanks to our dedication (and sponsors) we were able to realise our dream of reaching the international finals.

            <h5 class="center red-text">The Car</h5>

            <p class="red-text">Our body is modelled after modern 4x4 cars in production today. The main material used in the body is recycled paper from our school. This keeps the body extremely lightweight and performant while remaining sustainable. Our Chassis was based on a symmetrical trapezium to enable a 4-wheel steering system. We decided to use lightweight plywood sustainably sourced and then laser cut into the needed shape. The electronics are controlled by an Arduino board, running C, and a 2.4Ghz radio reciever.<br>
            In the future we're looking to step forward with new materials and techniques to create a car that can practically drive itself.<br>
            Of course this is not the full technical specification of our car, we are keeping our best features for reveal on the day, however, we are always thinking of new ideas to forward the technology and engineering inside the car, and would be grateful of any help (whether from an industry professional, or in funding for our competition) you can provide, just <a href="#contact-us" class="white-text">get in contact</a>.
